The Center for Collaborative & Conversational Intelligence (C3I) is affiliated with the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University and is led by Professor [Bowen Zhou](http://c3i.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/author/bowen-zhou/).

Our research objectives are as follows:

1. **Specialization and Alignment of Foundation Models**: This involves in-depth research on the architecture design, training, and alignment of foundation models, exploring specialization in reasoning and encoding.
2. **Multi-Dimensional Collaborative Research**: Based on a cognitive collaboration framework incorporating both System 1 and System 2, this area explores collaboration between large and small models, multimodal collaboration, and human-machine collaboration. It also investigates the interpretable mechanisms of neurodynamics and theories of sustainable hybrid human-machine intelligence.
3. **Application Development for Scientific Discovery**: Focused on the biomedical field, this research utilizes collaborative interaction technologies to drive knowledge innovation and promote scientific discoveries and technological advancements.
